# üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Token2022 CPI Compatibility in Solana

## üìå Problem Statement

The default instruction builders in the `spl-token` crate are **not compatible** with the `Token2022` program. These builders:

- Assume the use of the legacy SPL Token program (`spl_token::id()`).
- Hardcode instruction formats that don‚Äôt match the Token2022 layout.
- Fail when used with `spl_token_2022::id()`, causing silent errors or CPI failures.

This makes it difficult to perform CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) with Token2022 in Anchor-based Solana programs.

## ‚úÖ Solution

This project resolves the issue by **manually building Token2022 instructions** instead of relying on the default SPL builders.

### Key Fixes

- ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Manual Instruction Construction**  
  Used Token2022-specific instruction constructors such as:
  - `initialize_mint2`: Initializes a Token2022-compatible mint with flexible authority setup.
  - `initialize_account3`: Initializes a token account using the correct Token2022 layout.
  - `transfer_checked`: Safely transfers tokens, including validation of decimals and authorities.

  These instructions are provided by the `spl-token-2022` crate and conform to Token2022's extended specification.

- ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Dynamic Token Program Selection**  
  Introduced a `TokenType` enum:
  ```rust
  pub enum TokenType {
      Token,
      Token2022,
  }
